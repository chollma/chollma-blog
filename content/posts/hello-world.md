Last year (it's hard to believe that it's been that long, but I guess a pandemic will do that to time), I completed the #100 days of code challenge.
I set aside an hour each day that I dedicated to doing something with code. I'll admit that it started out easy, but over time I found myself trying to force
the hour into my schedule in the wee hours of the night. It wasn't a perfectly executed plan, but none the less, I did it. I spent a majority of the 100 days 
working on my own personal website. I've owned my own name-sake domain (cooperhollmaier.com) for a number of years now, but no website had made a home there.
In the months leading up to the start of my challenge, I painstakingly optimized my presence in search. I updated my social media profiles, I submitted removal
requests and cancellations. I mean if you can't practice what you preach, what good are you? Once I was satisfied with what showed up for "Cooper Hollmaier" in 
search results, I starting building the website. I fumbled around to find the right tech stack, the right styling, until I essentially gave up and told myself that
I wanted to bring it back to basics. I wanted a clean website, will full customization potential, and maximum speed.

So that's what I built. My personal landing page is pure HTML and CSS. It's as static as it gets. I'm able to customize the meta data to my heart's content. I'm able to
style it the way I want. In other words, the world is my oyster. Except this oyster I have to maintain myself. I have to edit every line of code everytime I create a new page.
It's not sustainable as my mind abounds with more ideas. More things that I want to showcase.

The newest feature I've added to the website is a blog. I wanted to write down all the ideas that have been rattling around in my head for ages. My motivations aren't what you'd
think though. I'm not hoping to get famous. I'm not looking for recognition. My hope is that I can help others and at the same time clean out the endless traffic jam of thoughts
and ideas up there that only gets worse with my perfectioninsm. I'm was and still am looking for a clear head. A sense of inner peace.

So I started a blog. I know. I know. That's what everyone is doing these days. But as you can see from above, I'm just hoping to put it on paper. As Anne Lamott would put it. I'm
just trying to get down my "shitty first draft". If it helps you, I'm overjoyed. If nothing else, this can serve as a record of the things I've learned, the thoughts I've had, and
ideas that have failed.

I know that you're probably thinking to yourself, "Why does this blog exist then?". I thought you wanted to keep it simple. Well, things evolved. I wanted to learn new things and try
to expand my skillset as a developer. I also got very tired of editing line after line of code just to get a blog published. What I want to do now is write.

This blog post is written in Markdown which for lack of better words is simply words. It's much easier for me to get ideas down on paper, edit, etc. That markdown is then converted
into HTML through the magic of this techstack, Vue.js and Gridsome. My previous website was hosted on Github pages, and this one will live on Netlify to allow me to take advantage of 
continuous deployment and some other cool features that Netlify offers. My hope is that this set-up will encourage me to write more and learn more about the inner workings of Vue.js. 
I understand HTML and CSS at a satisfactory level, and have gotten much better at JavaScript programming over the last year in time, but Vue is a skillset I'll need to build if I hope to
move my career laterally and move from SEO to a bonified software engineer.

So there you have it. New site, new frontiers. I'll go into more detail about how I built this site and why I chose the stack I did in a later post. 

Until then, be well.
