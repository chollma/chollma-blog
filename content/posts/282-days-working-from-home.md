*In 12 feet, you will arrive at your destination.* **12 feet**. That's my morning commute now. That's how far I have to walk from my bed
to my desk in the other room of our 650 square feet. You think that would excite me. You'd think I'd feel liberated â€” able to finally escape
the slow shuffle of the cars in front of me. But I feel more meloncholy about the whole thing. It feels like something is missing.

282 days. 77 percent of the year. That's how long I've been working from home. 

Before the pandemic (COVID-19) hit, I'd spend the first four days of my week commuting to an office. The last day of the week came as a bit of
a happy surprise. The one day I could unplug from meetings and communication and get some deep thinking done. Now the days all seem to blend together.

I think it's Wednesday. Or is it Thursday?

This year has been just as hazy as the hues of the Seattle skies. Not sure if it wants to be day time or night time. Just settling for an uncertain shade of gray.
That said, I've found a number of ways of coping with the forced reality that I hope will help you too. Here's my daily routine:

## Meditation

Admittedly, I've had a hard time getting behind this practice. I also have a hard time finding that one-on-one therapy is for me. What I do know is that my
biggest blocker is not having a clear mind. It's as if I'm stuck in a traffic jam and more cars keep appearing around me and I dream up new features, body styles, and paint jobs. As a result my brain wakes up and starts to rev its engine from 0-60. This is neither productive nor comfortable. Prior to adopting a few minutes of meditation at the start of everyday, I felt tired, stressed, and lacked clarity of purpose before the day ever began. 

So now, I wake up, shower, get a cup of coffee and resist the urge to look at my phone or crack open my email. I sit down at my desk and turn on Insight Timer. I set the timer for 3-5 minutes and just exist. I focus on my breathing and the idea of a clear mind. The metaphor that I like came to me from (insert title of headspace book). I take myself from standing in the middle of traffic to sititng on side of the road watching the cars go by. I'm self aware.

## Get Shit Done

One I've taken the time to clear my mind, I focus on the most important things I need to get done today. I resist the urge to check Slack or my email. I focus on that thing for the next hour or so. I found that when I left this stuff to the end of the day (because that's when I have less meetings in general), my mind was tired and I got almost instantly frustrated when I got stuck doing a task. Since I've shifting my important work to the front half of the day, I feel less frustrated and more productive.

In many cases, I'm a much more helpful partner once we get to communication and having meetings with others. I've just completed or worked on the things we'll be talking about and so my focus is already there.

## Communication/Synchronous Meetings

In a work from home environment, or any work environment for that matter, communication preferences matter. As I've made the transition from in-person to fully-remote, I find that asynchronous communication is far more efficient and satisfying. For me, context switching is a major time suck. If I'm deep in thought and I get an instant message notification, I can't help myself but respond in a timely manner. This derails my thinking and makes me feel discouraged. I've taken steps to remedy this roadblock. I dedicate 10 am to noon everyday to communication. I write my emails, respond to slack messages, and attend synchronous stand-ups during this time with few exceptions. Otherwise, I have notifications and interuptions turned down to keep my brain turned up.

## Personal Development

After what tends to be a meeting and work (get shit done) heavy morning, I need a break. I could make some lunch and sit in front of the TV or play some video games. I've definitely done this in the past. But I've felt guilty about not bettering myself during this time. As you'll see in another section of this article, I'm committed to fitting my "work" into working hours and not working nights or weekends. By fitting my personal development into the lunch hour, it gives me a chance to work on a passion project in the middle of the day and switch my brain off for a bit. If you know me, you know that often times I'll be working on something for work and come up with some other thoughts/ideas along the way. This time slot is about taking time to pull those ideas out of my head and put them somewhere vs. letting them bounce around in my head like a pinball machine.

## Other Work

It's hard, but after lunch I put down the passion project that I'm working on, but not without marking down a few to-dos for later if I feel up to it. This helps me remember what I was thinking and gives me some concrete goals for next time. After "powering down", I pick up where I left with work. Since I spent the few hours before lunch focusing on communication, it's likely that I'll have a few action items to take care of.

## Turning Off

## Exercise

## Personal Development

## Dinner

## Bed
