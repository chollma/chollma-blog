*In 12 feet, you will arrive at your destination.* **12 feet**. That's my morning commute now. That's how far I have to walk from my bed
to my desk in the other room of our 650 square feet. You think that would excite me. You'd think I'd feel liberated â€” able to finally escape
the slow shuffle of the cars in front of me. But I feel more meloncholy about the whole thing. It feels like something is missing.

282 days. 77 percent of the year. That's how long I've been working from home. 

Before the pandemic (COVID-19) hit, I'd spend the first four days of my week commuting to an office. The last day of the week came as a bit of
a happy surprise. The one day I could unplug from meetings and communication and get some deep thinking done. Now the days all seem to blend together.

I think it's Wednesday. Or is it Thursday?

This year has been just as hazy as the hues of the Seattle skies. Not sure if it wants to be day time or night time. Just settling for an uncertain shade of gray.
That said, I've found a number of ways of coping with the forced reality that I hope will help you too.

## Meditation

## Get Shit Done

## Communication/Synchronous Meetings

## Personal Development

## Other Work

## Turning Off

## Exercise

## Personal Development

## Dinner

## Bed
